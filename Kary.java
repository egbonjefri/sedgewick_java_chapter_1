//Assume that i is an integer in Java’s long data type and that k is
// an integer between 2 and 16. 
//For bases greater than 10, use the letters A through F to represent 
//the 11th through 16th digits, respectively

/*
 * To convert a decimal number to binary, you can use the following steps:

Divide the decimal number by 2.
Write down the integer quotient and the remainder (either 0 or 1).
Divide the quotient from step 1 by 2.
Write down the integer quotient and the remainder.
Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the quotient becomes 0.
The binary representation of the decimal number is the sequence of remainders from step 2 to step 5, read from bottom to top.
For example, let’s convert the decimal number 23 to binary:

23 / 2 = 11 remainder 1
11 / 2 = 5 remainder 1
5 / 2 = 2 remainder 1
2 / 2 = 1 remainder 0
1 / 2 = 0 remainder 1
