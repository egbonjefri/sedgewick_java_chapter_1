## Introduction to Programming with Java - Chapter 1 Solutions

### Introduction
This repository contains my solutions to the problem sets in Chapter 1 of "Introduction to Programming with Java" by Kevin Wayne and Robert Sedgewick
. Each Java file represents my approach to the exercises focused on fundamental programming concepts using Java.

### About the Chapter
Chapter 1 of Sedgewick's book introduces the basic concepts of Java programming, including data types, conditionals, loops, arrays, and input/output. It's designed to provide a solid foundation for anyone starting with Java.
