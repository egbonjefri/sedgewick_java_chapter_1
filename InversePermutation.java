/**
 * This program applies the inverse of a given permutation to return the identity permutation.
 * The identity permutation is a sequence where each element is in its natural order (e.g., 0, 1, 2, ...).
 *
 * Process:
 * 1. The program creates an array of length n from command line arguements.
 * 2. It calculates the inverse permutation. The inverse is found by placing the index of each element
 *    of the original permutation at the position indicated by the element's value in the inverse array.
 * The inverse of a permutation is another permutation that, when applied after the original permutation,
 *  returns the elements to their original order. In more formal terms, a permutation
π maps elements from positions to values. The inverse permutation, denoted π^−1 reverses this mapping, 
    taking values back to their original positions.
 * 3. It then applies this inverse permutation to the original permutation. This is done by reordering
 *    the elements of the original permutation according to the positions indicated in the inverse permutation.
 * 4. The result of this application is the identity permutation, which is then printed out.
 *
 * For example, given a permutation [2, 0, 1], its inverse is [1, 2, 0]. Applying the inverse to the
 * original permutation returns the identity permutation [0, 1, 2].
 * Original Permutation:
π=[2,0,1]
Inverse Permutation:
π^−1=[1,2,0]
Look at the First Element of the Inverse: 
π^−1[0]=1. This means that the element at index 1 of the original permutation π should be placed at index 0
 of the new permutation. In π, the element at index 1 is 0.

Look at the Second Element of the Inverse: 
π^−1[1]=2. This means that the element at index 2 of π should be placed at index 1 of the new permutation. 
In π, the element at index 2 is 1.

Look at the Third Element of the Inverse: 
π^−1[2]=0. This means that the element at index 0 of 
π should be placed at index 2 of the new permutation. In π, the element at index 0 is 2.
