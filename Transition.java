/*
 * By adding links from page 23 to every other page, 
 * you essentially increase the importance of page 23 in the graph. 
 * The PageRank algorithm interprets outbound links as 'votes' or endorsements. 
 * With page 23 linking to every page, it's as if it's endorsing every other page, 
 * which might increase its perceived importance. 
 * Dilution of Page 23's Outbound Influence: Although page 23 will have links to every other page,
 * each individual link's influence might be diluted because its rank is now divided among more pages. 
 * The impact of page 23's link to any single page will be smaller.
 * Potential Increase in Ranks of Other Pages: Pages that previously had few or 
 * no inbound links might see an increase in their rank due to the new link from page 23.
 * Overall Network Effect: The changes might have a cascading effect throughout the network. 
 * Pages linked by those that page 23 now links to might also see changes in their ranks, albeit to a lesser degree.

/*
 * If you add links to page 23 from every other page, rather than from page 23 to every other page,
 * the effects on the PageRank calculation would be quite different.
 * Increased Rank of Page 23: Page 23 will likely see a significant increase in its PageRank. 
 * This is because PageRank operates on the principle that a page is important if it 
 * is linked to by other important pages. By having every other page link to it, 
 * page 23 is effectively being 'endorsed' by the entire network, boosting its perceived importance.
 * 
 * Dilution of Rank for Other Pages: The pages linking to page 23 might see a slight
 * decrease in their own ranks. This is because their rank is now being distributed to more pages, 
 * including page 23. The effect will be more pronounced for pages that didn't 
 * have many outgoing links before the addition.
 * 
 * Reduced Influence of Existing Links: For pages with many outgoing links, 
 * the addition of one more link (to page 23) might not dramatically change 
 * their outgoing influence, but it does mean that the influence they exert through each link is slightly diluted.
 * 
 * Potential Cascading Effects: The increase in PageRank for page 23 might have secondary effects. 
 * Pages that page 23 links to might see a small increase in their ranks due 
 * to receiving a link from a now-higher-ranked page.
