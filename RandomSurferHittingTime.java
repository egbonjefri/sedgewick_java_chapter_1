 * Pages with higher PageRank are generally expected to have lower hitting times since they are visited more frequently.
* Conversely, pages with lower PageRank might have higher hitting times as they are visited less often.
* However, the structure of the graph and the specific arrangement of links can lead to nuances in this relationship.
